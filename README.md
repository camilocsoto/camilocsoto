# console.log('Hello world 👋')

Hi, I'm Juan Camilo Suarez 👾. I am a Systems Engineering student at Uniminuto. I've been working with frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI. I also have experience using Docker and Azure to deploy a few projects. Additionally, I consider myself skilled at creating and managing SQL and NoSQL databases. My goal is to transition into the machine learning and deep learning field to offer cutting-edge AI-based solutions 🚀.

I am an eternal student 💚.
