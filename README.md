👾 Hi! I’m Juan Camilo Suárez, a final-semester Systems Engineering student. I enjoy playing with data and building things with code. I’ve worked on data analysis and mining projects using R to develop supervised learning algorithms that reached 92% of accuracity, and I’ve also done web development with Django, Flask, and FastAPI. I’m comfortable working with Docker, Git/GitHub, and I have some experience setting up CI/CD pipelines with Azure and GitHub Actions.

I'm passionate about contributing to open source projects to make technical knowledge more accessible—especially through platforms like GitHub and Reddit. In academic spaces, I value giving and receiving honest, constructive feedback, and I actively participate in the Platzi community, where I share ideas and suggestions through the comment system.

I firmly believe in never stopping learning, and I constantly study topics related to machine learning and deep learning. If you're interested in collaborating, exchanging ideas, or just chatting about data and code, this repo is your space too! 🚀

At the end I am an eternal student 💚.
